- Determining missing number
- Project population growth
- Compute square root using traditional method

## Missing Number

[missing.c](/missing.c) takes an integer n and a subsequent list of integers as command line arguments and determines which number between 1 and *n* are missing from the list.

## Population Growth

[population.c](/population.c) project the population growth under two different models for *n* years.

## Square Root

[squareRoot.c](/squareRoot.c) computer the square root of a number *x* using a method developed for one of the first electronic computers (EDSAC).
