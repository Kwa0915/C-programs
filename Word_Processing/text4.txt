Doctor Who?

I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I hate yogurt. It's just stuff
with bits in. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't
know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. I am the
last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie
to me!

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every
time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. You hate me; you want to
kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! *Insistently* Bow ties are cool!
Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!
